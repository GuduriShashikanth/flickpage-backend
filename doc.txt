CineLibre - Project Documentation

1. Project Overview

CineLibre is a hybrid AI-powered recommendation platform designed to bridge the gap between Indian regional cinema (Bollywood, Tollywood, Kollywood, etc.) and global literature. It utilizes Semantic Search and Machine Learning to provide deep, meaning-based discovery rather than simple keyword matching.

2. Technical Stack

Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL) + pgvector for similarity search.

Backend: FastAPI (Python 3.11) hosted on Koyeb (Free Tier).

ML Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (Sentence Transformers) for 384-dimensional embeddings.

Automation: GitHub Actions for daily data ingestion.

Data Sources: TMDB API (Movies) & Google Books API (Books).

3. Completed Milestones

Phase 1: Database & Infrastructure

Supabase Setup: Initialized a PostgreSQL instance with the vector extension enabled.

Schema Design: Created movies and books tables with vector columns to store ML embeddings.

Vector Functions: Implemented Postgres RPC functions (match_movies and match_books) to perform high-speed Cosine Similarity searches directly within the database.

Phase 2: Data Engineering & Sync Engine

Sync Engine (sync_engine.py): Developed a Python script that:

Fetches metadata for 2000+ movies across 8 Indian regional languages.

Fetches hundreds of books across 30+ categories.

Generates ML embeddings for every item using sentence-transformers.

Performs an upsert to keep the database fresh without duplicates.

Automation (sync.yml): Configured a GitHub Action to run the sync engine every 24 hours at $0 cost.

Phase 3: Backend & ML API

FastAPI Core (main.py): Built a production-ready API with the following endpoints:

GET /: Health check.

GET /search/semantic: Converts natural language queries (e.g., "mystery in a small town") into vectors and retrieves matches from Supabase.

GET /recommendations/content/{id}: Finds similar items based on the vector of a specific movie or book.

Local Verification: Confirmed that the API returns accurate semantic matches (e.g., correctly identifying "Forest" and "Eklavya" for forest-based action queries).

5. Next Steps

Cloud Deployment: Finalize the deployment of api/main.py to Koyeb.

Frontend Development: Build the React/Tailwind CSS dashboard to consume the API.

Hybrid Logic: Implement Collaborative Filtering (SVD) once user interaction data begins to accumulate.

SaaS Features: Integrate Stripe for the "Pro" subscription tier.
